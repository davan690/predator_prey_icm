## Predator-prey IPM development files

``ipm_counts_cmr_preyJuvPredated_markedallyears_wproductivity_vaguepriors_noobserror.r`` is the endpoint of our current paper. Different versions of that file are used in ``numerical_experiment'' one level up. The subfolders here considered variants of the model:

* ``exp_predprod`` same file together with results for 1 simulation, 1 estimation
* ``improving_identifiability`` showing some identifiability diagnostics used in the Appendix C of the paper
* ``saturating_predprod`` implements the nonlinear predator fecundity functions highlighted in Appendix D
